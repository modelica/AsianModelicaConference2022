The Asian Modelica Conference 2022 will be held as a fully virtual event on November 24–25, 2022. It is organized by [Modelica Association](https://www.modelica.org/) in cooperation with [Sophia University](https://www.sophia.ac.jp/eng/index.html) and [Modelon K.K.](https://www.modelon.com/).

# About the Conference

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to all of the system simulation standards developed and maintained by the Modelica Association, in particular [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org/), the [Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)](http://www.fmi-standard.org/), the [System Structure and Parameterization (SSP)](https://ssp-standard.org/) standard and the [The Distributed Co-simulation Protocol (DCP)](https://dcp-standard.org/) standard and the [Functional Mock-up Interface for embedded systems (eFMI)](https://efmi-standard.org/) standard.

The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications. More details about the virtual conference platform will be available soon.

We are looking forward to seeing you online.

# Scope of the Conference

[Modelica](https://www.modelica.org/) is a freely available, equation-based, object-oriented language for convenient and efficient modeling of complex, multi-domain cyber-physical systems described by ordinary differential, difference and algebraic equations. The Modelica language and the companion Modelica Standard Library have been utilized in demanding industrial applications, including full vehicle dynamics, power systems, robotics, hardware-in-the-loop simulations and embedded control systems, etc. The [Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)](http://www.fmi-standard.org/) is an open standard for the tool-independent exchange of models and for co-simulation. It is supported by many [Modelica and non-Modelica tools](https://modelica.org/tools) and is the key to utilizing Modelica models in non-Modelica environments.

The Modelica conference will bring together people using any of the Modelica Association standards for modeling, simulation, and control applications, Modelica language designers, Modelica and/or FMI tool vendors and Modelica library developers. It provides Modelica users the opportunity to stay informed about the latest standards, library, and tool developments, and to get in touch with people working on similar modeling problems. The conference will cover topics such as the following:

*  Multi-engineering modeling and simulation with Modelica
*  Free and commercial Modelica libraries (mechanics, electrical, hydraulics, thermal, fluid, media, chemical, building, automotive, aircraft, ...)
*  Automotive applications
*  Thermodynamic and energy systems applications
*  Mechatronics and robotics applications
*  Other industrial applications, such as electric drives, power systems, aerospace, etc.
*  Real-time and hardware-in-the-loop simulation
*  Simulation and code generation for embedded control systems
*  Applications of Modelica for optimization and optimal control
*  Modelica modeling, simulation and design tools
*  Symbolic algorithms and numerical methods for model transformation and simulation
*  New features for future Modelica versions
*  Modelica in other application areas (mathematical programming, databases etc.)
*  Modelica for teaching and education
*  New features of future FMI versions
*  FMI in Modelica and non-Modelica applications and tools
*  Tools and applications using the SSP standard
*  Tool and applications using the DCP standard
*  Digital Twins based on MA technologies

In addition, the conference will include Vendors' exhibition.


# Call for Papers

You are encouraged to share your Modelica, FMI and other Modelica Association related work by submitting a paper in English. Further information about the submission and paper templates are available at [the conference site](https://2022.asian.conference.modelica.org/).
Papers and extended abstracts for presentations can be submitted via the EasyChair conference management system (login is needed first):

[EasyChair AsianModelicaConference 2022](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=modelica2022asian)

There, you can also read your reviews and hand in the final paper after the reviewing process has taken place.
In order to submit a paper, you need to have an EasyChair account.
Simply follow the provided instructions to create an account.
The same account can be used for several conferences over several years.
Once you have logged in, please choose option "enter as an author".
You can download the submission templates through easychair or here ([abstract](cfp/abstract-templates-Modelica2022Asian.zip), [paper](cfp/conference-templates-Modelica2022Asian.zip)), or upload your contribution in the section: "New submissions".
Simply follow the instructions.

The paper submission form includes the option to mark suitable topics for your paper. Please use this feature since it helps us to find suitable reviewers for your paper. Furthermore, there is the option to attach a .zip file to your paper. In this way, you can provide example models that correspond to your paper.
The conference proceedings will be published by the Modelica Association on its website and by Linköping University Electronic Press. Each paper will be individually referenced by a DOI.

# Exhibition and Sponsorship

To support the conference, and to get an opportunity to expose their Modelica- and/or FMI-related products and services, vendors will have the opportunity to sponsor the event and to participate in the exhibition. The sponsorship and exhibition will be avialable at the virtual conference as well.

A decision about the acceptance of sponsors and exhibitors will be based upon Modelica/FMI relevance of products and/or services at the time of application submission.
