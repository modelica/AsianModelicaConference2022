# About the Conference

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to all of the system simulation standards developed and maintained by the Modelica Association, in particular [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org/), the [Functional Mockup Interface (FMI)](http://www.fmi-standard.org/), the [System Structure and Parameterization (SSP)](https://ssp-standard.org/) standard and the [The Distributed Co-simulation Protocol (DCP)](https://dcp-standard.org/) standard.

The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications.
We are looking forward to seeing you.

# Scope of the Conference

The Modelica conference will bring together people using any of the Modelica Association standards for modeling, simulation, and control applications, Modelica language designers, Modelica and/or FMI tool vendors and Modelica library developers. It provides Modelica users the opportunity to stay informed about the latest standards, library, and tool developments, and to get in touch with people working on similar modeling problems. The conference will cover topics such as the following:

*  Multi-engineering modeling and simulation with Modelica

*  Free and commercial Modelica libraries (mechanics, electrical, hydraulics, thermal, fluid, media, chemical, building, automotive, aircraft, ...)

*  Automotive applications

*  Thermodynamic and energy systems applications

*  Mechatronics and robotics applications

*  Other industrial applications, such as electric drives, power systems, aerospace, etc.

*  Real-time and hardware-in-the-loop simulation

*  Simulation and code generation for embedded control systems

*  Applications of Modelica for optimization and optimal control

*  Modelica modeling, simulation and design tools

*  Symbolic algorithms and numerical methods for model transformation and simulation

*  New features for future Modelica versions

*  Modelica in other application areas (mathematical programming, databases etc.)

*  Modelica for teaching and education

*  New features of future FMI versions

*  FMI in Modelica and non-Modelica applications and tools

*  Tools and applications using the SSP standard

*  Tool and applications using the DCP standard

*  Digital Twins based on MA technologies

In addition, the conference will include Vendors' exhibition.
